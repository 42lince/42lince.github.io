                <h2>A short biography</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Cornell with a B.S. in computer science in 2014. After graduation I worked in Barclays Singapore for two years as a software engineer. When I realized it was no longer fun to solve excel spreadsheet problems for the traders I quit my job and moved back to New York for Cornell Tech. </p>
                <p>I am a big sci-fi fan. I like spending time with my friends, drinking gin & tonic and listening to indie rock and Jazz. I also have two kittens whose names are Triss and Yennefer (nerd alert).</p>
